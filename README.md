I have added default users that are created on intial migration 
Username : +971555111222
Password : @Password123
IsVerified : true

Username : +971555222111
Password : @Password123
IsVerified : false


Due to time contraints I would have added
1) api key authentication for connection with the external service
2) error logging
3) end point for adding users
